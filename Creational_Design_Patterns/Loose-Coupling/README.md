- software parts that communicate with each other have little to no knowledge of each other's actual implementation
- all about interfaces :) 
- loosely coupled black boxes = as long as the interfaces match, we don't care about implementation
## Benefits
- easier to work with large projects
- swap implementations
- testability
- components grow independently
