- a collection of pre-initialized objects whose initialization is heavyweight
- every time we need such an object, we take one from the pool
- once we are done with it, we return it back to the pool
- implemented usually with a Factory class

## Deprecated?
- debate ongoing - too much overhead to maintain such pool (still used in game development)
